### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which product are top sellers
- What are the product on peak sales

### Data Analysis
---
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM PAYMENT
WHERE PAYMENT_METHOD = CASH
```
