### Project Overview
---
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of 
the E commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in 
the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions 
which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight 
gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
---
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following action;
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involved the exploring of the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which product are top sellers
- What are the product on peak sales

### Data Analysis
---
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis;

```SQL
SELECT * FROM PAYMENT
WHERE PAYMENT_METHOD = CASH
```
